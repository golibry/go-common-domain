# go-common-domain

Ubiquitous domain language &amp; concepts to be used in Go projects

## Examples

The `_examples` directory contains standalone `func main()` programs showing how to use each value
object (URL, Email, DomainName, IPAddress, FullName, PhoneNumber, Identifier, Currency, Money,
Password, and domain errors).

Run an example directly with `go run` (examples are grouped by feature)

Note: `_examples` is intentionally prefixed with an underscore so Go tooling ignores it by default.
Using explicit paths with `go run` works as shown above.

Run all library tests:

```
go test ./...
```
